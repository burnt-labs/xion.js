# Main CI workflow that orchestrates other workflows
# Individual workflows (unit-tests, integration-tests, build) run independently
# This workflow can be used to run multiple checks together if needed

on:
  push:
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

concurrency: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}

jobs:
  # This workflow now delegates to separate workflow files:
  # - unit-tests.yml: Runs unit tests on every push/PR
  # - integration-tests.yml: Runs integration tests on main branch or manual trigger
  # - build.yml: Builds the monorepo
  # - dependency-validation.yml: Validates dependency versions
  # - release.yml: Handles releases
  
  # Note: GitHub Actions doesn't support calling other workflows directly,
  # so these workflows run independently based on their own triggers.
  # This file is kept for reference and can be removed if not needed.
